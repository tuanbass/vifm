Brief Description

    Vifm is a vi[m] like file manager with curses interface extended with some
    useful ideas from mutt.  If you use vi[m], vifm gives you complete keyboard
    control over your files without having to learn a new set of commands.  It
    goes not just about vi[m] like keybindings, but also about modes, options,
    registers, commands and other things you might already like in vi[m].

    Just like vi[m], vifm tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy.  So instead of
    working solutions which are set in stone user is provided with a set of
    means for customization of vifm to one's likings.  Though builtin
    functionality should be enough for most of use cases.
